      "Llamas are social animals and live with others as a herd. Their wool is soft and contains only a small amount of lanolin. Llamas can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they can carry about 25 to 30% of their body weight for 8 to 13 km (5‚Äì8 miles). The name llama (also historically spelled \"lama\" or \"glama\") was adopted by European settlers from native Peruvians.\n",

Today, we're announcing LangGraph Studio - the first IDE designed specifically for agent development - in open beta.LangGraph Studio offers a new way to develop LLM applications, providing a specialized agent IDE for visualizing, interacting with, and debugging complex agentic applications. In this blog, we'll give a brief overview of LangGraph and then explore how LangGraph Studio streamlines the development of agentic applications.LangGraph: Balancing agent control with agency  In January 2023, we launched LangGraph, a highly controllable, low-level orchestration framework for building agentic applications. Since then, we've seen  teams build more complex agentic applications for production; in turn, we've heavily invested in LangGraph, leading to a stable 0.1 release this past June.LangGraph features a persistence layer that enables human-in-the-loop interactions, and it excels at building complex (i.e. more than a single LLM call) applications that require highly domain-specific cognitive architecture. Most of the agents we see in production fit this description.LangGraph is fully open source, available in both Python and Javascript. It works with or without LangChain, and integrates seamlessly with LangSmith.LangGraph Studio: Visualize and interact with agent graphs for quick iterationWhile LangGraph offers a new framework for developing agentic applications, we also strongly believe that new tooling is needed to make the development process easier. Building LLM applications differs from traditional software development, requiring different tooling outside of the traditional code editor.Coding is still important to developing LLM applications ‚Äî after all, production-ready LangGraph applications have complicated custom logic in the nodes and edges of the graphs that are created. We don't aim to replace code editors but, instead, to augment the development experience with tools tailored for LangGraph applications. LangGraph Studio facilitates this by making it easy to visualize and interact with agent graphs, even if development still primarily happens in code. Visualizing graphs helps developers understand their structure. Furthermore, you can modify an agent result (or the logic underlying a specific node) halfway through the agent's trajectory. This creates an iterative process, by letting you interact with and manipulate the state at that point in time.While there is much more to explore, we're excited to introduce LangGraph Studio to start with bringing some of the core features of an agent IDE to the world.How to use LangGraph StudioLangGraph Studio is a desktop app, currently available for Apple Silicon. You can download a version here. Support for more platforms is coming soon.After you download and open LangGraph Studio, you will be prompted to log in with your LangSmith account. All users of LangSmith (including those with free accounts) currently have access to LangGraph Studio while it is in beta. You can sign up for a LangSmith account here.After downloading LangSmith, you can open a directory. At a bare minimum, this directory needs to contain a Python file with a graph defined in it. Next, you will need to create a langgraph.json file containing details such as where the agent is defined, which dependencies to install, and which environment variables to load. This file can be created in the UI, or can exist as a file in the directory already. For an example repository which meets these requirements, see this GitHub repo.After you open a directory, we will build an environment for you agent to run. After it builds, you should see a visualization of the graph along with a box for interacting with the agent.When you interact with the agent, you'll get a stream of real-time information about what steps are happening. You can see the agent decide which tools to call, call those tools, and then continue looping. You can interrupt the agent at any time if veers off course, or you can interrupt the agent to run it in a ‚Äúdebug mode‚Äù where it pauses after each step of the graph (so you can walk-through step by step).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0:00\\n\\n                            /0:19\\n\\n\\n1√ó\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nüí°At any point, you can interact with the state of the agent.If you don‚Äôt like what the agent responded with at a specific step, you can directly modify the response and then continue with that new response. This can be useful for simulating what would have happened if the agent or a tool returned something different.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0:00\\n\\n                            /0:14\\n\\n\\n1√ó\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can also modify the underlying code and then replay the node. LangGraph Studio detects changes to the underlying code files, allowing you to update prompts in your code editor and rerun nodes if an agent responds poorly. This can make it much easier to iterate on long-running agents.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0:00\\n\\n                            /0:20\\n\\n\\n1√ó\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusionBuilding agentic applications differs from traditional software development. While code editors remain important, new IDEs designed for agents are also needed. LangGraph Studio is a step in this direction, and we're excited to see how it enhances your workflow.For more on LangGraph Studio, check out our documentation.

Building LLM applications differs from traditional software development, requiring different tooling outside of the traditional code editor.Coding is still important to developing LLM applications ‚Äî after all, production-ready LangGraph applications have complicated custom logic in the nodes and edges of the graphs that are created.

LangGraph Studio facilitates this by making it easy to visualize and interact with agent graphs, even if development still primarily happens in code. Visualizing graphs helps developers understand their structure. Furthermore, you can modify an agent result (or the logic underlying a specific node) halfway through the agent's trajectory.

For an example repository which meets these requirements, see this GitHub repo.After you open a directory, we will build an environment for you agent to run. After it builds, you should see a visualization of the graph along with a box for interacting with the agent.When you interact with the agent, you'll get a stream of real-time information about what steps are happening.

    "#### ReAct Agent (Reasoning + Acting):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ReAct framework combines reasoning and acting in a single loop to handle tasks. The agent uses natural language reasoning (thinking through steps) and task actions (performing tasks like calculations or data retrieval).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent uses a combination of reasoning steps to guide actions in real-time, using feedback from those actions to further inform the next step in reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: The agent receives a question or task.\n",
    "- Step 2: It reasons aloud (in natural language) about how to solve it.\n",
    "- Step 3: Based on its reasoning, it takes actions (e.g., searching a database, calculating something).\n",
    "- Step 4: The results of these actions are integrated into its reasoning and may trigger further actions.\n",
    "- Step 5: It repeats the process until it arrives at a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combines thinking and doing (reasoning and actions).\n",
    "- Performs iterative steps, updating its process based on action results.\n",
    "- Typically handles complex decision-making scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Original task: ‚ÄúCalculate the total number of apples in a basket if there are 4 baskets and 7 apples in each.‚Äù\n",
    "- Reasoning: \"I need to multiply 4 by 7 to get the total number of apples.\"\n",
    "- Action: Perform the multiplication.\n",
    "- Result: \"There are 28 apples.\"\n",

    "### Self-Ask with Search Agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This approach allows the AI to ask itself follow-up questions when it doesn't immediately know the answer. It performs a recursive questioning process to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable ones.\n",
    "- Once the AI generates these follow-up questions, it performs an external search (e.g., through Google or an internal database) to gather the necessary information before formulating a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Receive a complex question.\n",
    "- Step 2: The agent identifies sub-questions or follow-up questions.\n",
    "- Step 3: It performs a search or fetches answers to these questions from external resources (like a web search).\n",
    "- Step 4: The answers are aggregated to provide a complete response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Emphasizes question decomposition.\n",
    "- Relies on external search for sub-questions.\n",
    "- Useful for answering open-ended or broad questions where the answer is not immediately available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Original question: ‚ÄúHow many moons does Jupiter have?‚Äù\n",
    "- Sub-question: ‚ÄúWhat is Jupiter?‚Äù (search)\n",
    "- Sub-question: ‚ÄúWhat are moons?‚Äù (search)\n",
    "- Finally, it retrieves the answer: \"Jupiter has 79 moons.\""

      "\n",
      "Here's how you can fix it:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1.  Reformat the Output:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   Instead of a table, ask your LLM to directly answer the question in a clear sentence:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   Follow up: What is the country with the largest population in Asia?\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Desired Output:** \"The country with the largest population in Asia is India.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.  Use a More Robust Parser:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   While LangChain's built-in parsing is helpful, you might need a more sophisticated parser for complex outputs like tables. Libraries like `pandas` could be used to parse the table data and extract the relevant information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3.  Chain with a Summarization Step:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   You can chain your question-answering process with a summarization step. Ask the LLM to summarize the table data, focusing on the largest population.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you'd like help with any of these solutions!\n",
      "\n",
      "For troubleshooting, visit: https://python.langchain.com/docs/troubleshooting/errors/OUTPUT_PARSING_FAILURE \u001b[0mInvalid or incomplete response\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mCould not parse output: Great catch! You're right, the table format makes it difficult for LangChain to parse the answer directly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few ways to address this, keeping in mind the goal is to have LangChain easily extract the information:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1.  Direct Question Phrasing:**\n",
      "\n",
      "As suggested, rephrase the follow-up question to prompt a more straightforward answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "follow_up = \"What is the country with the largest population in Asia?\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This encourages the LLM to respond with something like: \"The country with the largest population in Asia is India.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.  Structured Output:**\n",
      "\n",
      "You could try guiding the LLM to format its response in a more structured way.  For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "follow_up = \"Please list the top 3 most populated countries in Asia, including their names and populations.\"\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This might lead to an output like:\n",
      "\n",
      "* India: 1.4 Billion\n",
      "* China: 1.4 Billion\n",
      "* Indonesia: 272 Million\n",
      "\n",
      "LangChain could then potentially parse this list more easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3.  Post-Processing with Libraries:**\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need to handle more complex table-like structures, using a library like `pandas` after the LLM's response can be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import pandas as pd\n",

      "**Why LangChain Struggles with Tables**\n",
      "\n",
      "LangChain's output parsing is designed to work best with direct answers or structured data like key-value pairs.  Tables present a more complex structure, and LangChain's built-in parsers might not have the built-in logic to understand table rows and columns effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Solutions**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Direct Question Phrasing:** As you've already discovered, phrasing your follow-up questions to elicit a more straightforward answer can be very effective:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   follow_up = \"What is the country with the largest population in Asia?\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Structured Output Guidance:** You can try guiding the LLM to format its response in a way that's easier to parse. For example:\n",

      "   ```python\n",
      "   follow_up = \"Please list the top 3 most populated countries in Asia, including their names and populations.\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   This might encourage the LLM to output something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   1. India: 1.4 Billion\n",
      "   2. China: 1.4 Billion\n",
      "   3. Indonesia: 272 Million\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Post-Processing with Libraries:** If you need to handle more complex table-like structures, using a library like `pandas` after the LLM's response can be helpful:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",

      "1. **Direct Question Phrasing (Reinforced):**\n",
      "\n",
      "   As we've discussed, this is often the simplest and most reliable approach. Try to phrase your questions in a way that prompts the LLM to give you the information directly, instead of expecting it to format it as a table.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   follow_up = \"What are the top 3 most populated countries in Asia, along with their populations?\"\n",

      "Follow up: What is the full name of the author of the Harry Potter series?\u001b[0m\u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mJ.K. Rowling was born Joanne Rowling. After her publisher recommended she use a gender-neutral pen name, she chose J.K., adding the middle name Kathleen.

You correctly identified the author and gave some interesting background information. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how we can refine the approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Be more direct:**  The follow-up question could be simpler: \"What is the name of the author of the Harry Potter series?\" \n",
      "* **Focus on the key information:** Your intermediate answer provides extra details about her pseudonym, which isn't strictly necessary for this question. Stick to the core answer: \"J.K. Rowling\"\n",

      "* **Understanding Context:** Sometimes, the best follow-up questions depend on the overall context of the conversation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Dealing with Ambiguity:** If a question has multiple possible interpretations, try to clarify with the user. For example, if someone asked \"Who is John?\" you could ask \"John who?\" to avoid assuming who they're referring to.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Learning from Errors:** Don't be discouraged by errors! They're a valuable learning opportunity. Analyze what went wrong and use that knowledge to improve your approach in the future.\n",
