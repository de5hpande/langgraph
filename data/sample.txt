Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, known as the "Missile Man of India," was an eminent scientist, 
visionary leader, and the 11th President of India (2002-2007). Born on October 15, 1931, 
in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he played a crucial role in India's defense and space programs,
 contributing to the development of ballistic missile technology and the Pokhran-II 
 nuclear tests. A passionate advocate for education and youth empowerment, he inspired 
 millions with his vision for a developed India, outlined in books like *Wings of Fire* 
 and *Ignited Minds*. Despite his scientific achievements, he remained humble and deeply 
 committed to the nation's progress. Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while 
 delivering a lecture, leaving behind a legacy of innovation, dedication, and unwavering 
 patriotism.
